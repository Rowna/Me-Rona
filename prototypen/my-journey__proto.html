            <!-- Last Part -->
            <p>The whole Journey has taken more than three Months. In these days and in my age of 18 I have tried to get more experiences through the long road to Germany. At first, we had the plan to travel by plane from Lebanon to Turkey, there is my colleague waiting to give us a hand, and that had helped us a lot to know our destination in that Land.</p>
            <p>After buying life vests for each one of us, we had the decision to find a Bootlegger to get us to the border of Greece. In Turkey the Bootlegger took us to accomodate in "Yeni Erbil Otel", and at that Motel there were lots of passangers and strangers, that they have the same story of us. After long dealing we were on that poor boat more than 35 travellers, and that made me feel more scared and that led me to be the last one who got into the boat.</p>

                A friend of mine was able to drive us to one of a nearest Greek island. Rescue teams had evacuated all of the passengers and gave us foods and care with the explanation how to move on.
